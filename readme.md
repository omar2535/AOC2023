# Advent of Code 2023

Another year of learning rust! Again! WHOOOOO!
Coding in another language that I don't normally use is always pretty fun!
This year, my aim is to better learn about ownership!

## Running code

```sh
cargo run day<n>::part<n>::tests::day<n>part<n>
# IE: day3::part1::tests::day3part1
```
